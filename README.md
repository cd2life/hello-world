# hello-world
Ideas, practice, meaningful experimentation, projects for critical assessment...

Often I find I have questions after learning new aspects of a computer language. Here I want to write my questions down as well as my 
hypotheses to further my programming skills.

While learning about Design Patterns, I wondered if an interface is also inherited content of a superclass, that a subclass may access 
without using "implements". This is a good example of something I would experiment with using my IDE.

Placing these processes online, I may look at what I had done and ask more questions or find reasons as to why I think subclasses need to
implement interfaces separately and cannot simply inherit them.

This file is meant to ask questions and remind me of what inspired me to program my projects in the first place
